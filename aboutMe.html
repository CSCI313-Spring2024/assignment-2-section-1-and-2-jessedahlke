      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Growing up in a rural town in central Minnesota certainly isn't the
        usual start for those interested in and pursuring computer science
        professionally. However, I've had interest in the topic for as long as I
        can remember and hope to take that experience into the workforce after I
        graduate. <br />
        Outside of the tech world, some of the things I enjoy the most are
        kayaking, pickleball, and watching football. A larger list of my
        favorite hobbies, movies, and websites are listed below. Kayaking is one
        of my favorite pastimes due to its tranquility and the ability it has to
        remove so much stress of everyday life. <br />
        My work experiences includes retail in my high school years and working
        the production line last summer. During high school, I worked at the
        same grocery store for three years. During my time there, I was promoted
        to a shift manager position in which I would manage a group of employees
        and close the store each night. At my short summer job on the production
        line at 3M I assessed issues with automated machines and communicated
        with a small team to ensure the product was made accurately and
        efficiently. Although I enjoyed my time at my previous workplaces, as I
        go through college I continue to aim my vocational goals towards more of
        the things that interest me.
